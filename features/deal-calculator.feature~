Feature: Robot can calculate car discounts

So that I can do my homework
As a computer programmer
I want to create a robot that can work out the price of a car after its discount

Scenario: A company is selling cars at a discount of 17% off list price

Given a deal-calculating robot
When I tell it the list price of a car 
Then it will tell me the new price of the car
